# How to quote Yoda in grant applications
## Research Data Management in grant applications
Funders expect researchers to provide a statement on their data management policies
in a data management paragraph, as part of the grant application.
In addition, a research data management plan needs to be developed and maintained 
during the execution of the research project. 

The use of Yoda can ensure that you comply with many research data management requirements. 
Below we have enlisted several statements on Yoda that you can include in your grant application
or in a data management plan.

## Which repository or database do you use to manage your data?
```
Our research uses the research data management system Yoda. 
Yoda facilitates collaboration on data during research, archiving of data during and 
after research, and publication of research data.  
Data along with its metadata is shared within a closed user group, 
accessible to authorized users anywhere via an internet connection.  
Client user workstations can be any platform that supports Webdav protocol 
(e.g. Mac, Windows, Linux).   
Research data integrity is enhanced trough the use of the Yoda Vault, data can be 
deposited in the vault where it becomes read only.  
Vaulted data can be published (findable and citable via DOI Datacite identifier) 
and as such can be made available to the research community at large.   
All Yoda data is stored in at least two geographically spread locations. 
The data is stored and transmitted in encrypted format, 
Yoda complies with Utrecht University's Information Security policy 
for data classified as public, internal use, sensitive and critical. " 
```

## Which metadata standards do you comply with?
```
As a minimum, the metadata in Yoda will comply with the Datacite V4 standard. 
In addition the system facilitates validation by per-research-configurable metadata schemas based on JSONschema to support discipline specific metadata.   
The metadata is stored persistently along with the data and in the Yoda 
repository database. It is findable in Datacite upon publication of data. 
The metadata in the Yoda repository can also be retrieved via a service that
complies with the Open Archives Initiatives Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH).
```
Should you need to comply with a discipline specific metadata standard then contact
the Yoda team at yoda@uu.nl to obtain a configuration and support for that standard.

## Do you store your data in a certified repository?
```
Yoda is Utrecht University's institutional research data repository.  
It is registered as such with re3data.org. 
Yoda complies with Utrecht University's Information Security policy for data 
classified as public, internal use, sensitive or critical.  
```

## Does your repository comply with the FAIR principles?
```
Using Yoda, we aim to describe our data in compliance with the FAIR principles.

Our published data has the following characteristics:
- Our data is Findable via its DOI persistent identifier and the associated metadata.
- Our data is Accessible as it has been deposited in the Yoda repository along with accessibility classification and available either publicly downloadable as Open Data or available upon request in case of Restricted Data (sensitive data).
- Our data is Interoperable via information on semantics as part of the data itself.
- Our data is Reusable as per its explicit license that is part of the metadata.


## Can you provide details on your data repository? Is it FAIR?

Metadata scheme in YODA complies with the Datacite V4 standard, 
supplemented by discipline specific metadata. 
The metadata is stored persistently along with the data in the Yoda repository database. 
Data or metadata (if data cannot be published) is findable, harvestable and 
searchable by Datacite upon publication of data or metadata. 
For unpublished archived data, an EPIC handle is available.
 
Metadata is stored in machine readable formats.
 
Yoda allows referencing of other datasets or publications that are part of the 
same publication or project and will show up in the metadata.
