# Store, retrieve and process your data in Yoda

To work with data, first add the [Yoda Network Disk](../getting-started/index.md) 
to your workstation. Once this is done you can use your existing workstation applications and tools to
process Yoda data jsut like you would process locally stored data.


You will have access to the data compartments of user-groups for which you have been registered.

Regular members of the user-group are able to add, rename, delete files and folders.  
Read only members cannot make changes to files on Yoda.  However they are able to copy the data to their workstation (and make changes to that local copy).  

For incidental access, the Yoda portal also allows data to be uploaded and downloaded. This feature is added in Yoda 1.5 (to be released December 2019).
