# Data manager checks

When you start the archival process, the system will automatically check for a valid metadata file.

After that the data manager manually assesses the data-package as well.  If he finds unclarities in the description, he can ask for changes to the folder structure or data-package description before he accepts the package for archival.

The basic idea behind this assessment is that

- the data packages are self-evident for other researchers
- meet basic standards of quality
- comply to sensitive data and privacy rules and regulations.

This assessment consists of a number of checks. Each category will have its own checks. Below you will find the I-Lab’s Data Manager check as an example.

- Folders
    - logical structure
    - logical naming convention

- Codebook
    - the setup of the research
    - the variables of the dataset
    - the units used
    - the instruments
    - sampling method and
    - sample size,
    - experimental set up,
    - etc.

- Large dataset (multiple data objects, e.g. multiple excel sheets)
    - A document describing the relation between the data objects?

-  Raw data
    - If the data package contains raw personal data, the Accessibility should be closed or restricted.
    - If the dataset is based on raw data, which is not available in the set itself, there should be a reference to the location of the raw dataset.
    - If the dataset contains data processed from raw data it should contain a description on how the former has been derived from the latter, e.g. by providing algorithms and/or transformation scripts.

- Valid data
    - Validity of data in a formal sense; e.g. an excel sheet with calculations should not contain cells with warnings like ‘invalid value’.
