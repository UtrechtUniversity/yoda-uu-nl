# Yoda user management

All the data you store on Yoda is stored in user-groups. All folders starting with the pre-fix 'research-' are actually user-groups.

In general, the data manager will create a user-group for you. To be granted the privilege of creating your own user-groups, please contact the Yoda data manager. 

Some general rules with regards to Yoda user-groups:

- There are three possible roles for a user: manager, researcher and reader.
  - Manager: add/remove users, grant/revoke user rights, read/write/delete files and folders, submit to vault, publish.
  - Researcher: read/write/delete files and folders, submit to vault, publish.
  - Reader: read files
- A user can have **one** set of rights per user-group.
- User-groups can only be created/removed in the Yoda Portal.
- Once created, a user-group cannot be renamed.



## How to create a user-group

To create a user-group, you must be registered as a user-group-manager for the I-lab. You do so by contacting the data manager of the I-Lab per mail.

Once you’re registered you can create your own user-groups. To create a user-group navigate to the I-Lab portal and log on. Then:

- In the top-menu, select Group Manager 

- In the left pane of the Group Manager, titled Yoda Groups, select the I-Lab and press Add Group.
- A dialog starts to help you through the procedure:
  - Both the category and sub-category should be “ilab” (in small small caps)
  - Please note that only names in small caps are allowed. You can freely choose the name for the group, which will automatically be pre-fixed by 'research-'. .

## Add a non-UU employee to a usergroup

To add a non-UU employee, follow the procedure described in the previous section. However, instead of a  solis-mail address you fill out the persons own mail-address. He/she will be notified by mail that an account has been created and be asked to set a password.

## Add/revoke access rights for group-members

Within a group a user can have either one of the following rights

- Read – represented by an icon depicting an eye

- Read/write – represented by an icon depicting a persons head

- Manage – represented by an icon a medieval tower

To change the rights of user:

- In the home page, choose Group Manager in the top menu.

- In the right side of the screen, select the group you want to change user rights for.
- Select the user and press one of the buttons next to Change Role. The right button will grant more encompassing rights, the left button will downgrade rights.
