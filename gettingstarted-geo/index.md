Yoda allows you to safely manage your valuable research data. 
The data in kept in so called data compartments. 
The name of a data compartment starts with "research-".
The data in a data compartment can only be accessed by its members. 
A user can be a member of multiple data compartments.

Use the Yoda Network Disk to work with the data itself. 
Use the Yoda Portal to perform data management activities.

## Yoda Network Disk
Most of the time users will read and write research data files using the Yoda Network Disk.
To do so, simply add the network disk once to your workstation and use any 
application on your workstation to access the files.
Instructions to add the network disk vary per operating system (see menu item).

## Yoda portal
Use a browser to access the Yoda portal (see menu item for address). 

### Menu item Groupmanager
Use menu item Groupmanager to view the name and membership of data compartments 
that you are enlisted in.
Members can have either one of three roles: viewer, member or groupmanager.
A groupmanager can add/delete members or change their authorization.
A viewer can only read or download files.

### Menu item Research
Use menu item Research to manage your data (package). Each data compartment has two main folders.

#### Research area
The main folder named "research-..." contains current research data that reseachers
collaborate on. Data is kept in subfolders. The subfolders be organized according 
to the needs of the researcher. 

After completion of a study, the data in that subfolder can be deposited so that it is 
kept for 10 years or longer. Use the "Submit" button to deposite the subfolder, this will
copy the contents of the subfolder to the Vault folder as a new data package (see below).  
Before doing so, the subfolder must
be described with metadata (which can be entered by clicking on "Metadata").

#### Vault area
The other main folder named "vault-..." contains deposited data packages. 
The vault folder is read-only accessible to the compartment members.
Once deposited, data cannot be removed. Therefore the vault can be used to account for data
in a research project to comply with FAIR principles.

Researchers can opt to (but do not have to) publish any of the vault deposited data packages 
to make the metadata description of a data package known to the research community at large.
Yoda adds a DOI persistent identifier to published data so that the data package can be cited
and found in catalogs such as Datacite, Narcis, B2Find etcetera. 
If (and only if) the data has been classified as "open" then the content itself can be downloaded
from the internet. Otehrwise, only the metadata description can be viewed.
